# Why
I always forgetting how to make proportions, even in calculator, so I want some app that will show this intuitevely - in real life. 

# How (development)
We have:
- 4 EditText for entering numbers.
- 4 Buttons for every EditText. This button will calculate its corrisponsible field. 
- Reset button, which resets to 1:2, none:none
Like if on right it would be 16:9 and on top 1920, and we press right bottom button app calculate 1080


# How (user)
Initially user have to write 2 Numbers into right column (one of the EditText on start have value of 1.0 (for convinience)).
