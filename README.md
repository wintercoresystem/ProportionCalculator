# Why
I always forgetting how to make proportions, even in calculator, so I want some app that will show this intuitevely - in real life.

# How (development)
We have:
- 4 EditText for entering numbers (right bottom (r-b) is unclicabble at first)
- One TextView for showing result
- One Button to culculate result
On first calculations we have this formula:
**r-b = l-b / l-t**
On next calculations we only column that user edited last. Like if he edited l-t, we should change only right column. 

# How (user)
Initially user have to write 2 Numbers into right column (one of the EditText on start have value of 1.0 (for convinience)).
